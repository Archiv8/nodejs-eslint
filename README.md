## Package contents

This archive, downloadable from GitHub, contains the PKGBUILD necessary to compile ESLint from source with [makepkg](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg) and install it via (pacman)[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Additional_commands].

ESLint is an AST-based pattern checker for JavaScript.  Rapidly reading the code ESLint highlights any issues, many of which can now be fixed by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) itself.
